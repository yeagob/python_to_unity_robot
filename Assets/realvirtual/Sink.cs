    //! Sink component for removing MUs from the simulation, representing endpoints in material flow systems.
    
    //! The Sink is a fundamental component in realvirtual that acts as the termination point for MUs in the automation system.
    //! It simulates various endpoints such as shipping areas, quality control rejection points, recycling stations, or any location
    //! where products exit the simulated system. Sinks automatically detect and remove MUs that enter their trigger area.
    //! 
    //! Key Features:
    //! - Automatic detection and removal of MUs entering the sink area
    //! - Optional visual dissolve effect for smooth MU disappearance
    //! - Selective deletion based on MU tags for filtering specific products
    //! - Production statistics tracking (total destroyed, rate per hour)
    //! - PLC signal integration for controlled deletion
    //! - Collision-based detection using Unity trigger colliders
    //! - Support for both immediate and delayed destruction
    //! - Event system for tracking destroyed MUs
    //! 
    //! Common Applications:
    //! - End of production lines where finished products exit
    //! - Quality control stations removing defective items
    //! - Shipping and dispatch areas
    //! - Recycling and waste collection points
    //! - Buffer overflow handling
    //! - Testing and validation endpoints
    //! - Order fulfillment completion points
    //! - Rework station exits
    //! 
    //! Operation Modes:
    //! - Automatic Mode: MUs are destroyed immediately upon entering
    //! - PLC Controlled: Deletion triggered by PLC signals
    //! - Selective Mode: Only specific tagged MUs are destroyed
    //! - Statistical Mode: Tracks throughput without deletion
    //! 
    //! Visual Effects:
    //! - Dissolve Effect: Smooth fade-out using shader-based dissolution
    //! - Configurable fade duration for visual feedback
    //! - Compatible with standard and custom shaders
    //! - Optional immediate destruction without effects
    //! 
    //! Statistics and Monitoring:
    //! - SumDestroyed: Total count of destroyed MUs
    //! - DestroyedPerHour: Current throughput rate calculation
    //! - CollidingObjects: Real-time list of MUs in sink area
    //! - Event notifications for external tracking systems
    //! 
    //! PLC Integration:
    //! - Delete Signal: Triggers deletion of all MUs currently in sink
    //! - Can be integrated with production control systems
    //! - Supports batch processing scenarios
    //! 
    //! Performance Considerations:
    //! - Efficient trigger-based detection
    //! - Automatic cleanup of destroyed objects
    //! - Optimized for high-throughput scenarios
    //! - Minimal impact on simulation performance
    //! 
    //! Events:
    //! - OnMUDelete: Fired when an MU is destroyed
    //! - Provides destroyed MU reference for logging or statistics
    //! 
    //! Setup Requirements:
    //! - Requires BoxCollider component set as trigger
    //! - Automatically configured on component addition
    //! - Size determines the detection area
    //! 
    //! For detailed documentation see: https://doc.realvirtual.io/components-and-scripts/sink
